Are you finding it difficult to keep track of your insurance clients? Life as an insurance agent isn't easy. We understand. Link.me 
is a **desktop app built for insurance agents** to help you manage your clients. It is **optimized for use via a 
Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, Link.me can get your client management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

This user guide will guide you, as an insurance agent, through the process of setting up Link.me, introduce you to 
the capabilities of Link.me and facilitate your usage of Link.me so that you can better manage your

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Overview 

### Layout
The structure of the Link.me interface is split into five main parts:
![Layout](images/Layout.png)
The Input Command Line is where the user inputs the commands for execution.

The Result Display displays the result of the user input.

The Client List displays a list of client stored in Link.me, and changes according to the use input.

The Meeting List displays a list of meetings that are scheduled in Link.me.

The Status Bar displays status information regarding the storage unit. (Not relevant for basic users.)

![PersonLayout](images/PersonLayout.png)
Each client has basic information stored, as well as insurance plans and premiums attached.

![MeetingLayout](images/MeetingLayout.png)
Each meeting has the client stores, as well as the meeting time and a brief description of the meeting agenda.

### Functionalities
The features of Link.me mainly revolve around adding and editing clients as Link.me is first and foremost a client
managing app.

Features of Link.me include adding, editing, deleting, searching for and filtering clients. Link.me also supports peripheral features such as meeting scheduling, 
recording client notes and notifying the user of important upcoming events. 

Details on how to use each command are explained in the [Features](#features) section below.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the inputs to be supplied by you, the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` represents the client's name that will be inputted by you, the user. 
  For instance, if the client's name is "John Doe", you should input: `add n/John Doe`. 
  

* Inputs in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. in `n/NAME [t/TAG]`, while the input for `n/NAME` is mandatory, the omission of `[t/TAG]` will not lead
  to an input error. For instance, these two inputs are valid:
  * `n/John Doe t/friend`
  * `n/John Doe`
    

* Inputs with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. in `[t/TAG]…​`, the following inputs are valid:
  * `t/friend`
  * `t/friend t/family`
  * ` `  (an empty input)

    
* You can enter your inputs in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.


* If an input is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the 
  input will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.


* For commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`), any additional inputs
  will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. for the `help` command, if you input `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help` as `123` will be considered as
  a redundant command.


* The commands of Link.me generally follow the following format:
  `COMMAND [client_INDEX] [PREFIX]/[DESCRIPTION]`

</div>

### Listing all of your clients : `list`

#### Editing the data file

Link.me data is saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/linkme.json`. 
We generally discourage editing the JSON file directly. 
<!---We have locked the JSON as a precaution, but users are still able to unlock the file and forcibly edit the file.--->
The Link.me team does not take any responsibility in data loss or startup failures following invalid inputs.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, 
Link.me will try to discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run,
but if the damage is too excessive, Link.me may be unable to start up. 
In the case that this happens, please manually discard the data file to start the app.
</div>
